This repository contains a basic web landing page with a basic responsive design where we get change in colour while hover on menu.
In this file i have designed a basic website using Html for the body layout having a menu at the top of the every page and used css to add some flexible colours to the page and make it somewhat attractive.For its responsiveness i have used javascript which helped me to add a hover colour change and also a button for going to next page for the same.
